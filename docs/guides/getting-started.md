# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

## Installation

1. Open a shell of your choice.
2. Create a new Hugo site:
    ```shell
    hugo new site [path]
    ```
3. Switch to the directory of your new site:
    ```shell
    cd [path]
    ```
4. Clone this repository into the `themes/` directory or add it as submodule:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/medialesson/hugo-theme-event.git themes/event

    # or

    git submodule add git@github.com:medialesson/hugo-theme-event.git themes/event
    ```

5. Add and adapt the following minimal settings to your [Hugo
   configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/):
    ```yaml
    theme: event
    sectionPagesMenu: main
    params:
        themes:
            event:
                # ðŸ‘‡ Set the name of your event.
                title: My Event
                # ðŸ‘‡ Fetch the ID of your event's API endpoint from
                # ðŸ‘‡ https://sessionize.com/app/organizer/schedule/api/0
                # ðŸ‘‡ and enter it here.
